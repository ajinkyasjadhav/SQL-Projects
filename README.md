# SQL Data Cleaning - Nashville Housing

The Nashville housing data gives detailed information about the houses and their buyers (including the total cost
of the property at which it was purchased)
Substring, CTE, Window Functions, Joins, Alter, drop and Update SQL commands are used to 
1. Standardize Date format 
2. Populate missing Address
3. Breaking Entire Address into Address, City, State & storing it in individual columns.
4. Changing the values from Y to 'Yes' and No to 'Sold as Vacant'
5. Removing duplicates
6. Delete the unused columns
from Nashville housing data.
